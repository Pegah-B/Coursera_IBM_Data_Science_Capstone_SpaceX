# Predictive Analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing

In this capstone project, our goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, significantly cheaper than other providers whose costs exceed $165 million each. This cost discrepancy is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, accurately determining the success of the first stage landing directly impacts the overall cost of a launch. This information becomes crucial in scenarios where alternate companies aim to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches. The ability to predict the outcome of the first stage landing not only ensures cost efficiency but also enhances competitiveness within the space launch market.

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, by Coursera and IBM.
